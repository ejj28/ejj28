# Hi there, I'm Erik Colley
### About Me:
I'm a Canadian high school senior looking to enter the IT field, and programming is one of my hobbies. I've programmed for my high school's robotics team, **FRC 6854 Viking Robotics**, where I spearheaded the programming subteam's move to using Git & Github for version control and to facilitate better collaboration between students. I've also developed numerous personal projects in my spare time.
### Some of my projects:
 - [MidiDrumHero](https://ejj28.github.io/mididrumhero) [![Github Downloads](https://img.shields.io/github/downloads/ejj28/mididrumhero/total.svg)](): A utility to accompany the game Clone Hero, a community-developed Guitar Hero clone. MidiDrumHero allows users to play Clone Hero using their Electronic Drum Kits and MIDI keyboards by translating MIDI inputs to virtual gamepad button presses.
 - [Tasky](https://github.com/ejj28/tasky): A simple task manager utility I wrote as part of a VB course I took. Tasky's features include killing tasks, basic CPU usage monitoring and displaying system information .
 - [Syne](https://github.com/ejj28/syne): A music player and library manager (still in early development).
 - [t1dgrapher](https://github.com/ejj28/t1dgrapher) A small script for graphing CGM and Insulin Pump data for cross-examination.
 - [windowgen](https://github.com/ejj28/windowgen) A small script for generating MacOS 8-style windows of any size
