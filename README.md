# Hey there, I'm Erik
I'm a Canadian IT student, and programming is one of my hobbies.
### Some of my projects:
 - [MidiDrumHero](https://ejj28.github.io/mididrumhero) - A utility to accompany the game Clone Hero, a community-developed Guitar Hero clone. MidiDrumHero allows users to play Clone Hero using their Electronic Drum Kits and MIDI keyboards by translating MIDI inputs to virtual gamepad button presses
 - [ChiliCheese](http://chilicheese.livingmas.com) - An improved Taco Bell Chili Cheese Burrito locator site, built for [Living MÃ¡s](https://livingmas.com). Featured by [MLive News](https://www.mlive.com/life/2021/06/hey-90s-kids-yes-you-can-still-get-taco-bells-chili-cheese-burrito.html)
