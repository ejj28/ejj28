# Hi there, I'm Erik Colley
### About Me:
I'm a Canadian student currently studying to enter the IT field, and programming is one of my hobbies. I've previously acted as the lead programmer for First Robotics Competition Team 6854, [Viking Robotics](https://github.com/frc6854), where I spearheaded the programming subteam's move to using Git & Github for version control to facilitate better collaboration between students. I've also developed numerous personal projects in my spare time.
### Some of my more notable projects:
 - [MidiDrumHero](https://ejj28.github.io/mididrumhero) [![Github Downloads](https://img.shields.io/github/downloads/ejj28/mididrumhero/total.svg)](): A utility to accompany the game Clone Hero, a community-developed Guitar Hero clone. MidiDrumHero allows users to play Clone Hero using their Electronic Drum Kits and MIDI keyboards by translating MIDI inputs to virtual gamepad button presses
 - [ChiliChee.se](https://chilichee.se): An improved Taco Bell Chili Cheese Burrito locator site, built for [Living MÃ¡s](https://livingmas.com)
